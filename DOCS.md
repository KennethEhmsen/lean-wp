## LEAN WP Wiki

list of features:

* jkahd
* kjahsd
* wjeh

If a plugin that disables blogging altogether is installed and activated on your site, then the menu reorder function of LEAN WP is not executed to avoid conflicts with these other plugins. The plugins we make this exception for are:

* [Disable Blogging](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-blogging/) by Fact Maven
* [Disable Blog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-blog/) by Joshua Nelson

The LEAN WP plugin also moves the setting menus of plugins that add them to the top, to the bottom. A big offender of this is Jetpack, but there are others too.
If you use the Disable Blogging plugin then you will need to go the its Settings > Menu tab and untick the box that says _Reorder Pages menu to the top_. Only then will our function that moves plugin settings menus to the bottom of the admin sidebar work.
